<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
<h3>Due Friday, October 16 at 11:59pm</h3>

<p>This second programming assignment is to give you practice writing loops and manipulating strings.  Arrays are not needed, <em>and you should not
use arrays in your assignment</em>.  All the methods you create should be <tt>static</tt>.</p>

<p>While it may be tempting to hunt through the API to find classes and methods that can shorten your code, you may not
do that.  First reason is that this homework is an exercise in writing loops, not in using the API.  The second reason is that in a lot of cases, the API methods may shorten the <em>writing</em> of your code but increase its <em>running time</em>.
The only classes and methods you can use are listed below.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: you must not use either <tt>break</tt> or <tt>continue</tt> in your code.  These two commands almost always are used to compensate for
a poorly designed loop.  Likewise, you must not write code that mimics what <tt>break</tt> does.  Instead, re-write your loop so that the loop logic does not need break-type behavior.</p>

<p>You <em>are allowed</em> to use the following from the Java API:
<ul><li>class String
    <ul><li>length</li>
        <li>charAt</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class StringBuilder
   <ul><li>length</li>
       <li>charAt</li>
       <li>append</li>
       <li>toString</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>class Character
    <ul><li>any method</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>JOptionPane</li>
    <ul><li>ShowInputDialog</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>General Guidelines (20% of your grade will be based on using good style)</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>All methods listed below must be <tt>public</tt> and <tt>static</tt>.</li>
<li>No additional methods are needed.  
However, you may write additional <em>private</em> helper methods, but you still need to have efficient and simple algorithms. Do not write helper methods that do <em>unnecessary</em>
traversals of the data.</li>
<li>You should place a comment at the top of the file that contains your name
and a short description of the purpose of the class.</li>
<li>You should place a <em>short</em> comment before (directly above) each method describing the method.  The comment should
be only describe <em>what</em> the method does, not <em>how</em> it does it.  Do not simply copy the descriptions
below for your comments.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment directly above each field (should you really have any?)
indicating the purpose of the variable.</li>
<li>You should place a short comment above each loop explaining how the loop works.  Ideally, you should list the goal of the 
loop, any required precondition for the loop, and if you can, a good iteration subgoal for the loop.</li>
<li>Any other complicated code such as code the has lots of if statements or variables should contain <em>short</em> comments to help the reader.  The comments can either be above the code fragment or to the right, aligned in a column.</li>
<li>If your code is using a loop to modify or create a string, you need to use the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> class from the API.</li>
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You should not use the commands <tt>break</tt> nor <tt>continue</tt> in your loops.</li>
<li>Remember to use good style: everything should be indented nicely, variables should have good names, there should be a blank line between each method.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>To submit your project, click on the <em>HW 2</em> link, and you should find a <em>Submit</em> link.  Attach your
Java file and your testing report.
Remember to attach the files that end in <tt>.java</tt>, not <tt>.class</tt> or <tt>.java~</tt>.</p>

<h3>Part I: Programming (60% of your grade will be correctness of the following)</h3>

<p>Try to keep your code as simple as possible.</p>


<p>Create a class called <tt>HW2</tt> that contains the following methods:
<ol>

<li><p><tt>replaceFirstK</tt>:  takes a <tt>String</tt>, two <tt>char</tt>s, and an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt>
that is the same as the parameter <tt>String</tt> except that first <tt>int</tt> occurrences of the first <tt>char</tt> parameter are replaced with the second <tt>char</tt> parameter.
<pre>
> HW2.replaceFirstK("Mississippi River", 'i', 'I', 3)
"MIssIssIppi River"
> HW2.replaceFirstK("Missouri River", 'r', '*', 3)
"Missou*i Rive*"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>allChars</tt>: takes two <tt>char</tt> parameters.  Creates a <tt>String</tt> containing all characters, in order,
from the first <tt>char</tt> parameter (inclusive) to the last (inclusive).
<pre>
> HW2.allChars('d', 'm')
"defghijklm"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>showCharOfString</tt>:  takes two <tt>String</tt> parameters.  Outputs a new <tt>String</tt> that is the same as the
first <tt>String</tt> except that: for each character of the
first <tt>String</tt>, if the character is not in the second <tt>String</tt>, replace that character with the underscore ('_').  
<pre>
> HW2.showCharOfString("Missouri River", "s SR!r")
"__ss__r_ R___r"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>hangman</tt>:  Takes a <tt>String</tt> and an <tt>int</tt> and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.  The method plays the game of hangman where the <tt>String</tt> is the word
the player must guess and the <tt>int</tt> is the maximum number of "bad guesses" allowed.  The game should work as follows:
  <ol><li>Creates a <tt>StringBuilder</tt> that stores all the letters guessed by the player.  The <tt>StringBuilder</tt> should initially be empty.</li>
      <li>Has a loop that does the following:</li>
      <ol><li>Calls the <tt>showCharOfString</tt> on the parameter <tt>String</tt> and a string containing all the guessed letters.</li>
      <li>Uses <tt>System.out.println</tt> to print the <tt>String</tt> returned from the previous step as well as the total
 number of "bad guesses" so far. (<em>For fun, you can print a graphical hangman instead of the number of bad guesses.</em>)</li>
      <li>Uses <tt>javax.swing.JOptionPane.showInputDialog</tt> to get the next guessed letter from the user. The method should not crash if the user does not enter appropriate data.</li>
      <li>If the letter has not yet been guessed, adds the letter to the <tt>StringBuilder</tt> containing the guessed letters and if the letter is not in the input <tt>String</tt>,
           increases the count of "bad guesses" by one.</li></ol>
      <li>The loop repeats until either: all letters of the parameter <tt>String</tt> are guessed or the number of "bad guesses"
           equals the <tt>int</tt> parameter.</li></ol>
   Finally, the method returns <tt>true</tt> if the player guessed all the letters of the input <tt>String</tt> without reaching the limit on "bad guesses", and false if the "bad guesses" limit was reached.
   You should organize your loop so the return statement is after the loop terminates.</p></li>

<li><p><tt>hiddenInString</tt>: takes two <tt>String</tt> parameters and an <tt>int</tt> as input and returns a <tt>boolean</tt>.
The method returns <tt>true</tt> if we can find the second string inside the first string by starting at any position of the first string
and reading every <em>k</em>th character where <em>k</em> is the <tt>int</tt> value input to the method.
<pre>
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "cad", 1)
true
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "cad", 2)
false
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "baaa", 2)
true
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "ab", 3)
true
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "abc", 3)
false
> HW2.hiddenInString("abracadabra", "bar", -3)
true
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><tt>capitalizeWords</tt> takes a <tt>String</tt> as input and returns a <tt>String</tt> as output.  Any word in the input string (a word is defined as a sequence of Enlish letters plus the hypen <tt>-</tt>)
that contains any capitalized letter will have all its letters capitalized in the output string.
<pre>
> HW2.capitalizeWords("Guess what??  There are twenty-sIx letters in the English alphABEt!")
"GUESS what??  THERE are TWENTY-SIX letters in the ENGLISH ALPHABET!"
</pre>
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Extra Credit (up to 10%)</strong>: Create method that plays a solitaire game of hangman.  The method takes a <tt>String</tt>
and a <tt>int</tt>.  The <tt>int</tt> is again the maximum number of "bad guesses", but the <tt>String</tt> is a file that contains
possible words for the game.  This method should open the file, count the number of words in the file (a word is defined as a sequence of English letters only), then call 
<tt>Math.random</tt> to pick a random number that indicates which word it should use.  Then the method should
extract that word and call the above <tt>hangman</tt> method to play the game.  You will need to use the <tt>java.io</tt>
package from the API to open and read from a file.  A list of words file will be provided for you on the homework page, but your method should work with any text file.</p></li>

</ol></p>

<h3>Part 2: Project Testing (20% of your project grade)</h3>

<p>You need to write tests for each of the methods above.  Your tests should be thorough.
Your testing report should describe why your test cases sufficiently tested your code as well as the specific tests you ran and their results.
If you are unable to complete a method above, you should still
describe tests that would test the method had it been completed.</p>

<p>Hints for testing loops.  Your tests need to, at the minimum cover the following cases:
<ol>
<li><strong>Test 0, test 1, test many:</strong>  This means you have to test cases where the parameters, if they are integers,
are 0, 1 or some value other than 1.  If the parameters are strings, you have to test strings of length 0, 1, and more than 1.
If the strings must contain certain data, you need to test cases where they contain 0, 1, and more than 1 of the desired data.</li>
<li><strong>Test first, last, and middle:</strong>  In cases where you have to search in or modify a string, you need to test
cases where the item to be found or modified is the first character of the string, the last character of the string, or somewhere
in the middle of the string.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>In summary, your tests should cover each of the above cases for each of the methods you complete in the homework.
Your testing report should state what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> mean for each of the homework
methods and how your tests covered these cases.</p>

<p><strong>JUnit</strong>: you will be learning about JUnit soon in a lab.  JUnit will be required for future homeworks, and you are welcome
to use it with this homework.  If you choose to write JUnit tests for your code,
your report should not list the specific tests and their results because the graders can run your JUnit tests.
Instead, your report should only detail what <em>test 0, test 1, test many</em> and <em>test first, last, and middle</em> means for each
method and why your JUnit tests cover those cases.
